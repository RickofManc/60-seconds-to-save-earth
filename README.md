## About

Climate Change requires a tremendous amount of global focus if humanity is to redirect the trajectory to burn up Earth. It is therefore imperative to educate all generations of the environmental damage caused by burning fossil fuels such as coal. This browser based, arcade style game aims to make learning fun with an objective to combat the building of more coal burning Power Stations with renewable energy in the form of a Wind Turbine.

## User Experience Research and Design


### Strategy

The game is targeted at a wide user base, starting from school children where concepts of the environment are first taught. The website should provide a clear message that continued use of fossil fuels has a negative impact on Earth's environment. To engage users, an arcade style will be adopted for the game as these are clear in terms of layout and centre around having fun. Using the classic game ['Whac-a-Mole'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole) as the platform, users will have '60 Seconds to Save Earth!' 

#### Leading User Stories


#### Primary strategic aims for the website
* Educate on the impact of burning fossil fuels on Climate Change. 
* Create a game that can improve reaction times and hand-eye coordination.
* Make learning fun!


The roadmap below highlights the high-level strategic opportunities versus the importance and viability/feasibility of development for the MVP (Minimal Viable Product):

### Scope

An agile approach of keeping the in scope features simple and aligned to the strategy for the MVP will be adopted.
Below is a list of the leading features for the game.

* An opening screen that clearly informs of the game scenario and what is required of the user.
* A button the user can click to initiate the start of the game when they are ready.
* In-game imagery to help convey the scenario
* In-game features that inform the user on;
    * the name of the game,
    * their score,
    * the time remaining to play,
    * when they score with an incremental score increase, screen flash, and sound clip.
* An alert to inform the user the game is over and their final score.
* The ability to 'Play Again'.
* The opportunity to learn more about the impact of burning fossil fuels on Climate Change.
* 404 error page to inform users they have navigated from the main content, or that there may be a bug with the website.

#### Out of Scope Features (for a future release)
* Allow users the ability to Pause and Resume whilst in-game
* Allow users to increase the game difficulty from the default 'Easy to 'Hard.
* In-game background music that can be toggled on/off either before or during the game.
* Differing images of fossil fuels being burnt.
* Animate the images when a hit is recorded.
* Countdown timer changes font colour when there is 10 seconds remaining.
* When there is 10 seconds remaining the in-game music quickens and a voice calls out the remaining time (10, 9, 8...).
* Share the user score with friends and other players on social media.
* Inform users how their score compares with others through a leaderboard.


### Structure

This website will be structured with the following design considerations;
* The Information Architecture (IA) will follow a Hub and Spoke design, with the in-game page as the Hub, and pop-up screens as the spokes for the Game Start and Game Over screens.
* The Game Start screen will introduce the user to the game scenario and the ability to start the game.
* When the user clicks the 'Start Game' button the user will be taken through to the in-game screen and the game commenced.
* Users will use the mouse pointer to hit the Power Stations are they pop-up in the screen.
* At the end of the 60 seconds, the Game Over screen will be displayed, informing the user of their final score.
* The user will be provided with an option to 'Play Again' which will return them back to the Game Start screen.
